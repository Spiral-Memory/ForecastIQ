## ðŸ“˜ Description

Supply chain management requires accurate demand forecasting to plan procurement, inventory, and delivery efficiently. This research focuses on evaluating and improving demand forecasting using a range of statistical and deep learning models, including:

- Classical models: **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**
- Deep learning models: **RNN**, **LSTM**, **GRU**, **BLSTM**
- Enhanced models: **LSTM with Ensemble Learning**

The paper explores ensemble learning in two variations:

1. **Without model pruning**: Averaging all LSTM models
2. **With model pruning**: Removing underperformers and averaging the top models

## ðŸ“Š Results

Experiments were conducted using a public dataset from the **University of Chicago**. Notably, the **LSTM model enhanced through ensemble learning with model pruning** achieved a **very low RMSE of 9.26**, demonstrating the potential of this method in improving prediction accuracy for customer demand.
